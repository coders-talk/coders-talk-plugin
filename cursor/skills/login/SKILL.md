In the commands below, `<plugin>` is the absolute path of the plugin folder: this file is `<plugin>/cursor/skills/login/SKILL.md`.

1. Run:

   ```
   node "<plugin>/scripts/keepplain.mjs" login --agent=cursor
   ```

   It opens the approval page in the browser and returns at once. If it says the computer is already connected, show that and stop.

2. Tell the user, in your reply, the link and the code it printed: the page shows the same code, and they press Connect there if it matches.
3. Then run, with a timeout of at least 2 minutes:

   ```
   node "<plugin>/scripts/keepplain.mjs" login --wait --agent=cursor
   ```

4. Show what it printed:
   - "Connected … as @…": done.
   - "Still waiting": ask the user to press Connect and tell you when they have, then run the step 3 command again.
   - Cancelled or expired: say so; the user can type /keepplain-login again.

Never ask the user for a token or to paste one into the chat. Never read or print `~/.keepplain/credentials.json` or environment variables: everything you print becomes part of the conversation.

Run the commands as written, only with `<plugin>` filled in: the script finds the site address and the sign-in by itself. Do not check the site, search, or run anything else on your own.

The library (the `keepplain` MCP server in Cursor's settings) signs in on its own through the browser: the user connects it under Settings → MCP → keepplain.
