/**
 * KeepPlain for Claude Code and Codex: sends the current session to https://keepplain.com as a draft Build.
 * The same commands run as the plugin's script (node keepplain.mjs …) and as the single keepplain file (plan,
 * stage 13.1: scripts/build.mjs), which needs no Node.js.
 *
 *   node keepplain.mjs login [--wait]         opens the browser sign-in; --wait waits for Connect and saves the token.
 *                                                 In a terminal it waits at once: no agent stops it after two minutes
 *   node keepplain.mjs preview [session-id]   trims the session, checks it for secrets, saves it next to the temp dir, prints
 *                                                 what would go and where
 *     --keep=<numbers>                            send these findings of the last preview as they are (see lib/privacy-settings.mjs)
 *     --private | --team=<slug>                   only you see the draft / that team does; by default the site decides by the
 *                                                 repository: a team's repositories go to the team, the rest stays private
 *   node keepplain.mjs send [session-id]      sends what preview saved, waits for the import, prints the draft link
 *     --continues=<slug or link>                  the draft continues that Build of yours: they become a series
 *   node keepplain.mjs discard [session-id]   the person said no: deletes what preview saved (it goes after 30 minutes anyway)
 *   node keepplain.mjs auto [on|team|push|off] auto mode for this computer and agent: send sessions by themselves while
 *                                                 they run and when they end (all of them, or only those in repositories of
 *                                                 teams that ask), or only when their commits are pushed (push, with the git
 *                                                 hooks); Claude Code and Codex are switched separately
 *   node keepplain.mjs auto session [on|off] [session-id]  auto mode for this one session, over the computer's:
 *                                                 on sends it (as `auto on` would) even when auto mode is off, off never does
 *   node keepplain.mjs auto-send <session-id> what the SessionEnd hook runs in the background when auto mode is on
 *     --sync                                      the Stop hook's send of a session that is still going
 *     --push                                      the pre-push git hook's send of a session behind the push
 *   keepplain git-hook <kind> <git's args>    the repository's git hooks (lib/githooks.mjs): prepare-commit-msg, pre-push
 *   node keepplain.mjs auto-catch-up <session-id>  what the SessionStart hook runs: sends the sessions that never said
 *                                                 they ended (lib/auto.mjs, catchUp), other than the one starting
 *   node keepplain.mjs team-rules-check --cwd=<repository>  what the SessionStart hook runs when a team's rules
 *                                                 in the repository were not checked for a while (lib/team-rules.mjs)
 *   keepplain rules [on|off] [--refresh]      the rules the SessionStart hook adds to sessions in this repository (lib/rules.mjs):
 *                                                 the person's own and their team's for its stacks; on|off for this computer
 *   node keepplain.mjs rules-fetch --cwd=<repository>  what the SessionStart hook runs in the background for that
 *   node keepplain.mjs whoami | logout
 *   node keepplain.mjs mcp-call <tool> [--json='{…}' | --stdin]   one call of the KeepPlain library's MCP tools, for agents
 *                                                 that have no MCP of their own (Pi's extension registers the tools and runs this)
 *   node keepplain.mjs mcp-headers            what Claude Code runs for the plugin's MCP server (.mcp.json, headersHelper; a fixed https://keepplain.com/mcp):
 *                                                 prints {"Authorization": "Bearer …"} for the saved sign-in, or {}
 *   node keepplain.mjs nudge [on|off]         the Stop hook's suggestion to share a session that used the library
 *   node keepplain.mjs hook <agent> <event>   the plugin's hooks in one command (lib/hooks.mjs): claude-code or codex,
 *                                                 session-start, prompt, stop or session-end
 *   keepplain update [version]                the single file only: replaces itself with the latest release (lib/update.mjs)
 *   keepplain sessions [--limit=N]            the Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and Pi sessions of this folder, newest first (lib/sessions.mjs)
 *     --all [--days=N]                            every folder's, changed in the last 30 days, each with its project
 *   keepplain build [number|session-id]       in a terminal: preview, a yes or no, send. The number is one from
 *                                                 `sessions`; without one, the newest session. Takes preview's and
 *                                                 send's options. Not without a terminal: nothing may skip the question
 *   keepplain use <build link or slug>        a published Build's playbook (plan: library, stage 22.3, lib/playbooks.mjs):
 *     --as=skill|rule|prompt                      shows the text, where it goes and what changed since the version here;
 *     --agent=claude|codex                        for which agent (in a terminal it asks when both are here)
 *     --write                                     writes it (a terminal asks instead); a prompt is never written
 *                                                 A team's own Build needs the sign-in: the token goes to the site then only
 *   keepplain use --team=<team> --stack=<stack>  the team's rules for a stack (22.5): its pitfalls, one block in
 *                                                 CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md; --agent and --write as above
 *   keepplain share [build link or slug]      a published Build on GitHub (lib/share.mjs): without one, this session's
 *     --pr[=<pull request link>]                  the block "How this change was built" in the session's pull request,
 *                                                 with the person's own gh
 *     --readme                                    the "Built with AI" section in the repository's README (not committed)
 *     --write                                     changes them (a terminal asks instead)
 *   keepplain share auto [on|off]             attach published Builds to their pull requests by itself: the site's
 *                                                 setting (Settings → GitHub), run by the SessionStart hook
 *   keepplain share-auto --cwd=<repository>   what the SessionStart hook runs in the background for that
 *   keepplain enable | disable | status       connects Claude Code and Codex to this keepplain through their plugin
 *                                                 systems, takes that off again, says how things are (lib/enable.mjs)
 *     --yes  --agent=claude-code,codex  --auto=off|on|team|push  --mcp=remove|keep
 *     --git-hooks | --no-git-hooks | --no-trailers   this repository's git hooks (lib/githooks.mjs)
 *   keepplain privacy [set --stdin]           the words to hide in every session (privacy.json); set takes a JSON list on stdin
 *   keepplain version | help
 *   --json                                      for a program (the desktop app, desktop/): status, sessions, preview, send,
 *                                                 discard, login, whoami, logout, enable, disable, auto, rules, nudge and
 *                                                 privacy print JSON, one object a line; long commands an {"event"} per
 *                                                 step; a failure is {"error": "…"} on stdout. login --json waits for
 *                                                 Connect until the code expires, and --client=desktop names the token
 *   --site=https://…                            another KeepPlain (the plugin's "url" option)
 *   --agent=codex                               a Codex session: the id defaults to CODEX_THREAD_ID
 *
 * Two steps to send on purpose: the person sees the summary and says yes before anything leaves the machine,
 * and what is sent is exactly what they saw, going where they saw. The secrets the check recognises are redacted here,
 * before anything is sent (lib/privacy.mjs, the rules the site uses): those values never reach the site, not even for a
 * check. What it does not recognise goes as it is, so the output says so. Nothing is published: that happens on the site,
 * and a draft is visible only to its sender, or to the team whose repository the session ran in.
 * The token never passes through the model: the browser sign-in hands it straight to this script.
 * As a script it needs Node.js 20 or newer and nothing else.
