/**
 * Auto mode (/coders-talk:auto, $coders-talk:auto, /coders-talk-auto in Cursor): whether this computer sends an agent's
 * sessions to a Coders Talk site by itself. Off unless the person turns it on here, per site and per agent: turned on in
 * Claude Code it never sends Codex, Cursor or Pi sessions, and the other way round. A team can ask for it, never switch
 * it on.
 *
 *   all   every session: to the team's space when the repository is one of the person's teams', else to their
 *         private Builds
 *   team  only sessions in repositories of teams that ask for it (auto_capture); everything else stays here
 *   push  only sessions whose commits are pushed, when they are (plan, stage 13.5: the repository's pre-push hook,
 *         lib/githooks.mjs); the agents' hooks send nothing in this mode
 *
 * One session can choose for itself (`auto session on|off`, trackSession's `own`): `on` sends it as `all` would even
 * when the computer's mode is off, `off` never sends it whatever that mode is. Turned on only by the person, like the rest.
 *
 * A session goes while it runs (syncIfDue: the Stop hook after each answer, and Claude Code's PostToolUse during a long
 * turn, sync it every SYNC_EVERY_MS of work), once more when it ends (SessionEnd), and at the next start if it never
 * said it ended: a crash, a closed terminal (SessionStart catches up). The site asks the model for moments when the
 * session is over, and again when it went on after that.
 *
 * Every agent runs the same hooks (lib/hooks.mjs): hooks/hooks.json for Claude Code, codex/hooks.json for Codex, the
 * hooks.json Cursor reads from ~/.cursor, and Pi's extension, each with --agent=<id>. Codex runs a plugin's hooks only
 * once the person trusted them in /hooks.
 *
 * ~/.coders-talk/auto.json holds the choice; ~/.coders-talk/auto.log says what happened to each session, so the
 * person can always check what left the machine without being asked; ~/.coders-talk/auto-sessions.json remembers,
 * for the sessions auto mode saw, where their file is and how much of it went. Never anything from the conversation.
