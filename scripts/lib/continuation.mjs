/**
 * Which session this one continues (grouping plan, stage 24.1). The Claude app's "continue" (and running out of
 * context there) starts a new session whose file begins with the lines of the one before it, copied with the new
 * session's own sessionId but their uuids kept. ForkWatch cannot see that: nothing in the lines names the other session.
 *
 * So the uuids tell. The sessions of the same project from the last 30 days that share the first uuids of this one are
 * the candidates; of those, the predecessor is the one whose own lines, those this session did not copy, start before
 * this session's own do (a session continued twice has two successors sharing the same start: the one before both wins,
 * having the most in common and the earliest own lines). The Claude app's own record of it (priorCliSessionIds in its
 * session metadata, a format that is not ours) is taken first when it is there and readable.
 *
 * A sample of each session's uuids is kept in ~/.keepplain/uuids/<id>.json, so a folder of hundreds of sessions is
 * not read whole at every send; a file that changed since is read again. Nothing here leaves the machine but the id of
 * the session continued and when this one left it.
